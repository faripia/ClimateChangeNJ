# ClimateChangeNJ
# At first glance, looking at the dataset and the average annual temperature from the year 1895 to 2021, it did not seem like there were any major changes. Computing the average of every years’ winter and summer months helped create a more organized and specific dataset. In addition, creating the line chart and trend line, displayed and highlighted the effects of climate change on New Jersey’s summer and winter temperatures. This code can be used in a country wide, regionwide, or state wide setting to show the effects of climate change in a different area. This data gives factual evidence that climate change is real and not just affecting glaciers, small islands, and Asia, it is happening in New Jersey as well.
